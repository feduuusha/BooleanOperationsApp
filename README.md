## About the Project

An application for working with Boolean functions in a nice interface. 

The project is a continuation of the BolleanOperations project.

The Boolean Operations application was created by me to optimize the work with boolean functions. At the moment, there is no such application on the Internet that provides the necessary tools for me to work with boolean functions

The application provides opportunities to work with functions written explicitly (example: (!X1 & X2) | X3), and also with functions written as a vector (example: 1000 0001).

You can explicitly write the function using '!' - negation, '&' - conjunction, '|' - disjunction

## Built With
- Java
- JavaFX
- Launch4j

## Functionality 

* Building a truth table of a logical function
* Construction of FDNF (full disjunctive normal form)
* Construction of FCNF (full conjunctive normal form)
* Construction of an abbreviated DNF (disjunctive normal form)
* Construction of a dead-end DNF (disjunctive normal form)
* Building a Quine table
* Construction of a minimal DNF (disjunctive normal form)
* Construction of the Zhegalkin polynomial

## Application requirements
* Java 11.0.2+
